  <description />
  <content>
	&lt;p&gt;Today I stood with hundreds of Arizonans to protest the inaugaration of "45". 
	I can't say his name. I spoke on  behalf of Democracy for America-Maricopa County. 
	We will be organizing to elect progressive candidates to the Az. Legislature, 
	City Council, and school boards. We will work to find a new Governor and Senator. 
	But, we need your help. Join us at our monthly meet-ups on the 3rd Wed. of each month. 
	We meet at Coco's Restaurant @ 2026 N 7th St. Meet, greet and order from the menu 
	begins at 6 pm. Meeting starts at 6:30 pm. For more information contact Toby using
	the &lt;a href=&quot;contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; link on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
